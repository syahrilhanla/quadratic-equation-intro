	"We can tell from Old Babylonian clay tablets dating from around 2000 BC that the Babylonians knew how to solve a pair of simultaneous equations of the form",
	"In the 8th Century BC quadratic equations of the form ax2 = c and ax2 + bx = c were explored in ancient India, using geometric methods. Babylonian mathematicians from circa 400 BC and Chinese mathematicians from circa 200 BC used the method of completing the square (see Section F4.3) to solve quadratic equations with positive roots, but did not have a general formula.",
	"In 628 AD, Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician, gave the first explicit solution of the quadratic equation but it was not until 1896 that the first reference to the general solution",
